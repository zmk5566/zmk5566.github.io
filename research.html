    <p>    I never thought I would perform this much teaching so far in my life because I am being too self-righteous and depressive, which doesn't fits any part of my imagination of the characteristics you can get from a decent teacher.        </p>
    <p>    But I have done them anyway.</p>
    <p>    I received a scholarship(Professor Samuel Chanson Scholarship) for being one of the best teaching Assistant in the computer science engineering department, HKUST, which feels like the biggest compliment I have ever received in my life so far.</p>
    <p>    A few workshops related with creative coding in music are hosted by me because I like the idea of gathering. </p>
