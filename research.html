            <div>I was a undergraduted students in Bsc Computer Science in University of Birmingham (in the uk) back in the days. I don't think I have done much in this project but it is the first research project I have ever participated in. I actually learnt a lot by watching other people(and robots).</div>
            <div>This project inspired me putting a lot of efforts into robotics and the field of doing research. Our team ended up scored 2nd price in UK-RAS filed robotics challenge in 2016. Horrrray!</div>
